# 🧠 Clustering Comparison App: KMeans vs. Hierarchical Clustering

An interactive Streamlit web application to compare **KMeans** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques. Upload your own dataset, choose features, and explore clustering results visually — including dendrograms for smaller datasets.

## 📌 Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- Upload a CSV file
- Select two numerical features
- Apply KMeans clustering (`k=3` and `k=4`)
- Apply Hierarchical clustering with various linkage methods
- View scatter plots and dendrograms
- Adjust the number of clusters and dendrogram threshold

🧠 A hands-on project built to explore customer segmentation and clustering techniques.
